          <p class="answer">
            AcaPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and
            each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Acala blockchain.

          <h3 class="title">Roadmap</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            AcaPunks aims to be a long-term community-driven project. We plan to explore ideas such as:
            DAO token airdrops to holders, whitelisting holders to future Parachain Labs projects,
            sharing the profit of Acalart marketplace and future Defi projects, etc. These are the
            things we have in mind but we'd like to hear from our community first, before setting our
            roadmap in stone.
