            I've written <a href="//adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/" rel="noopenner noreferrer" class="text-green-900 hover:underline hover:font-bold">a few thousand words</a>
            on why traditional "semantic class names" are the reason CSS is hard to
            maintain, but the truth is you're never going to believe me until you
            actually try it. If you can suppress the urge to retch long enough to give
            it a chance, I really think you'll wonder how you ever worked with CSS any
            other way.

            Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering
            your stylesheets with arbitrary values. They make it easy to be consistent with color
            choices, spacing, typography, shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered
            design system.

            With five minutes to kill on your commute, or between meetings, which app do you open?
            For many of us, it is Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or gaming apps. But for more and more
            teenagers, it's a metaverse platform to check-in on their avatar.

          <p class="mb-4">
            Your avatar can resemble how you look in the real world. Or, you could pretend to be
            someone, or something, totally different. That's half the attraction.
